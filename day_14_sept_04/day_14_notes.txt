Set
===
-Sets are ordered lists of values that contain no duplicates.
let carSet = new Set();
carSet.add('tata');
carSet.add('honda');
console.log(carSet.size);
console.log(carSet.has('tata')); 
carSet.delete('maruti'); 
carSet.clear();

Map
===
-Map Stores the data in Key:Value pair

object vs map
-------------
1. object keys must be strings/symbol, where as map keys can be of any type.
2. You can get the size of a Map easily.  ex: map.size
   for object, size has to be calculated manually. ex: Object.keys(obj).length
3.The iteration of maps is in insertion order of the elements
4.Objects are not inherently iterable (Object.keys() is slow), Maps are iterable.


Symbol Datatype
===============
-Symbols are used to create hidden properties inside objects.
-in an object the key should be either string/Symbol type.  
let Symbol1 = Symbol('id');
user[Symbol1] = 111;
-symbols are not iterated while we iterate object using for in



Class 
=====
-A class is a Structure/BluePrint/Template for Objects
-Class doesn't have physical existance
-Class has logical existance

Object
======
-Object is an instance of class
-Object has physical existance
