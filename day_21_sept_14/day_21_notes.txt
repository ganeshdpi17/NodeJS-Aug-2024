Package.json
============
-Contains the metadata of the project.
-Helps NPM to understand how the project should be handled along with its dependencies.
-package.json files contain the below information.
	  project name,
	  version,
	  homepage,
	  description,
	  author,
	  keywords 
	  scripts 
	  dependencies 
	  devdependencies
	  optionaldependencies etc.
-package.json file is normally located at the root directory of a Node.js project.


package.json  VS  package-lock.json
===================================
-package.json maintains only the main packages's information.
 "cors": "^2.8.5"
 "bootstrap" : "^5.2.1"
-package-lock.json containes the exact version. 
	"bootstrap" : "5.3.2" (npm update bootstrap)
-package-lock.json maintains main packages's information + nested-packages information
    "node_modules/cors": {  
      "dependencies": {
        "object-assign": "^4",
        "vary": "^1"
      }
-package.json lists the required dependencies and their version ranges, but not the exact versions to be installed.
-package-lock.json is used to ensure that the same dependencies are installed across different environments and prevent conflicts due to different versions being installed.

-package.json is created and modified manually by the developer.
-It is automatically generated by npm and updated whenever you install or update packages.

-in package.json (~) tells go up to hot-fixes 1.4.X if 1.4.1 is installed
 in package.json (^) checks if there is a newer version under 1.x.x if 1.4.1 is installed
 in package-lock.json - there is neither ~ nor ^




NPX
===
NPX : Node Package Executer (used to execute Node.js packages)
-executes Node.js commands without installing them.
-NPX comes inbuilt with nodeJS
-we can install npx using the below command
 npm i -g npx
-npx helps us avoid versioning, dependency issues and installing unnecessary packages that we just want to try out.
-provides a clear and easy way of executing packages, commands, modules and even GitHub gists and repositories.
-ex:npx create-react-app my-sample-react-app
    npx nodemon file1.js
    


Nodemon
=======
-Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
-Nodemon can be installed using NPM.
 ex:- npm i -g nodemon
-Nodemon can be used without installing also, using npx
 npx nodemon file1.js
-nodemon help
 nodemon -h 
 nodemon --help
-Just use nodemon instead of node to run your code, your process will automatically restart when your code changes
 ex:- node file1.js      (server won't be re-started when code is changed)
      nodemon file1.js   (server gets re-started when there is a code change)
	  npx nodemon file1.js   (server gets re-started when there is a code change)
-The 'node_modules' folder is ignored by default by nodemon.
-You can restart the process at any time by typing 'rs' and hitting enter.


Node.js Global Objects
======================
-Node.js global objects are global in nature and available in all modules.
-we don't have to include these objects in our application; they can be directly used.
-A list of Node.js global objects are given below:
	__dirname
	__filename
	console - log(),error(),warn(),time(),timeEnd(),trace(),dir(),assert(),table()
	process - exit(),beforeExit(), uncaughtException()
	buffer
	setImmediate(callback[, arg][, ...])
	setInterval(callback, delay[, arg][, ...])
	setTimeout(callback, delay[, arg][, ...])
	clearImmediate(immediateObject)
	clearInterval(intervalObject)
	clearTimeout(timeoutObject)
	structuredClone()
	atob()
	btoa()
	exports
	require
	fetch
	global
	globalThis
	module


Note: 
__dirname :  __dirname is not defined in ES module scope

to use __dirname in ES modules, use the below code
const __dirname = import.meta.dirname;



Nodejs Global Variables
=======================
-In Node.js, the global object is global.
-abc.js
 global.myGlobalVariable = "Hello from global!";
-xyz.js
require('./abc');
console.log(global.myGlobalVariable);
