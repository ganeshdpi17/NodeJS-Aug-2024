Heap - Memory area where all the variables are stored

Stack / CallStack - initially the Call Stack is empty. 
When the first function call is made, a new frame is pushed onto the top of the Call Stack.
When that function returns, its frame is popped off of the Call Stack

Note: Only the regular functions can be placed in callstack directly, where as callbacks won't be placed in callstack directly

callback functions have to wait in callback queue, and they will get a chance to execute only after all the regular functions are executed(callstack is free)

Callback queue : is the area where all the callback functions keep waiting.
Callback Queue : 1. Task Queue       (setTimeout , setInterval)
                 2. Microtask queue  ( Promise)

Event Loop : Keeps checking  CallStack & Callback queue , when event loop finds that callstack is empty/Free and callback queue has functions , it brings 1 function from callback queue and assigns to callstack for execution
